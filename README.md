# bbisv2
bbisv2 is a blood bank inventory system for blood bank staff to monitor blood supply & keep track of blood donor records. In addition to insert new & update existing
blood bag records, the system will display expired blood bag & blood component that is running low on supply based on the preset value by the user, allowing
the blood bank to ensure constant availability of blood supply.
